  Scenario: Create, edit then preview an Opaque question.
    # Create a new question.
    And I add a "Opaque" question filling the form with:

      | Question id      | omdemo.text.q01      |
      | Question version | 1.2                  |

    # Preview it.
    When I click on "Preview" "link" in the "Test Opaque question" "table_row"
    And I switch to "questionpreview" window
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Marks | Show mark and max |
    And I press "Start again with these options"
    Then I should see "A catalyst speeds up a reaction"
    And the state of "A catalyst speeds up a reaction" question is shown as "You have 3 tries."

    And I press "Check"
    Then I should see "Your answer is  incorrect."
    When I press "Try again"
